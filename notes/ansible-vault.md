### üîê What is Ansible Vault?

Ansible Vault is a tool that lets you **encrypt and protect sensitive data** like passwords, API keys, and full files in your Ansible projects.

### üí° What can you do with Ansible Vault?

#### 1. **Encrypt and Manage Full Files**

- **Create an encrypted file:**  
    `ansible-vault create filename.yml`  
    You type your secret info in the editor, and it gets saved encrypted.
    
- **View an encrypted file:**  
    `ansible-vault view filename.yml`  
    You need to enter the password to see the content (read-only).
    
- **Edit an encrypted file:**  
    `ansible-vault edit filename.yml`  
    Opens the editor for changes. Password is required.
    
- **Change the password:**  
    `ansible-vault rekey filename.yml`  
    Updates the encryption password.
    
- **Encrypt an existing file:**  
    `ansible-vault encrypt filename.yml`
    
- **Decrypt a file (make it normal again):**  
    `ansible-vault decrypt filename.yml`

#### 2. **Run Playbooks with Encrypted Content**

- If your playbook or variables are encrypted, Ansible will need the password.
    
- **Ask for password during run:**  
    Use `--ask-vault-pass`
    
- **Use password from a file (for automation):**  
    Use `--vault-password-file my_pass.txt`
    

---

#### 3. **Encrypt Only Specific Variables**

- You can encrypt just one variable (like a password) instead of the whole file.
    
- **Interactive encryption:**  
    `ansible-vault encrypt_string`  
    It asks for the text to encrypt and gives back a `!vault` block to copy into your playbook.
    
- **Command-line encryption:**  
    `echo "mysecret" | ansible-vault encrypt_string --stdin-name 'my_var'`  
    It gives you a ready-to-use encrypted variable.

### ‚úÖ Tips

- Uses **AES-256 encryption** (very strong).
    
- Better to use **one password for all secrets** in one project.
    
- You can encrypt **any file**, not just Ansible ones.
